Notes:

Warning: GitHub Pages sites are publicly available on the internet, even if their repositories are private or internal. If you have sensitive data in your site's repository, you may want to remove it before publishing. For more information, see "About repository visibility."

If you enable HTTPS for your GitHub Pages site but your site's HTML still references images, CSS, or JavaScript over HTTP, then your site is serving mixed content. Serving mixed content may make your site less secure and cause trouble loading assets.
To remove your site's mixed content, make sure all your assets are served over HTTPS by changing http:// to https:// in your site's HTML.
